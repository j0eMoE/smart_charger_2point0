Project folder for the design of a level 1 bidirectional charger

For this project I designed a level 1 bidriectional EV charger capable of charging/discharging a 4kWh battery pack up to 20A @ 120VAC

Uploaded files include:
- firmware for the TMS320F2808 digital signal controller which was written in embedded C
- JS/HTML written for the Muratta SN8200 wifi controller (connected to TMS320F2808 through I2C) for wireless access
- altium files for pcb design
- matlab/simulink files used for controller development and design

My apologies for the poor organization
